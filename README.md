# Disqualification-director-Assessment

Extracting the data and loading it into JSON format.

1. First, I created a virtual environment. In that particular environment I install Selenium in VS-Code.  “pip install selenium” 
 1.a. Before working on selenium, I also have to download the   ChromDriver.exe exact same version of my Google Chrome version otherwise it will provide an error.
 1.b. The python libraries used for the assessment.
   
2. I extracted and downloaded the HTML and CSS data script from this source : "https://www.iomfsa.im/enforcement/disqualified-directors/".

3. And apply selenium classes to explore the data and convert it into JSON format file as final output.
